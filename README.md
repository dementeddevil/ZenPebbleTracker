# Zen Pebble Tracker
Pebble Time WatchApp designed to work with the Seeed Xadow Smart Strap

The Xadow smart-strap is designed to work with a Basalt edition Pebble Time or Pebble Time Steel
The application is currently able to read from the GPS and NFC modules and the battery on the strap can be switched on and off with regard to charging the watch itself (it typically only provides power to the modules)

This application will be extended to perform simple recording functions and who knows what else (perhaps a GPS watch face!)
